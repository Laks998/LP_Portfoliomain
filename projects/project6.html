      <!-- Description -->
      <p>
        This project set out to explore <strong>René Descartes’ theory of dualism</strong> — the idea that mind and body are distinct. Instead of approaching it as abstract philosophy, I used <strong>Virtual Reality (VR)</strong> to create an experience where people could <em>feel</em> that separation by combining insights from psychology (dissociation, out-of-body experiences, lucid
        dreams) with VR technology, the goal was to design an immersive environment that could
        trigger a sense of mind–body dualism.

    <!-- Environment Design -->
    <section class="environment">
      <h2>The VR Environment</h2>
      <p>
        I designed a <strong>lift (elevator) scenario</strong> in Unity, structured to build
        tension and trigger heightened emotional states:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Confined entry:</strong> participants began in a dimly lit elevator interior, seated in a matching real-world chair.</li>
        <li><strong>Ascent:</strong> creaking sounds, groaning metal, and shifting lights simulated a rising, unstable lift.</li>
        <li><strong>Exposure:</strong> the doors opened into a <strong>panoramic 360° cityscape</strong>, revealing extreme height.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of control:</strong> camera movement subtly shifted without user input, producing a sense of being moved externally.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This sequence was deliberately structured to create <strong>emotional intensity</strong>,
        a known trigger for dissociation from both literature and participant interviews.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Process -->
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <ol class="process-steps">
        <li><strong>Literature Review</strong> — studied dualism, dissociation, lucid dreaming, OBEs, VR illusions.</li>
        <li><strong>User Interviews</strong> — 8 participants shared real experiences of dissociation, often tied to emotional highs or lows.</li>
        <li><strong>Prototype Design</strong> — built elevator environment with matched chair setup and soundscape.</li>
        <li><strong>Pilot Study</strong> — 2 participants tested the prototype. Feedback:
          <ul>
            <li>Height didn’t feel convincing.</li>
            <li>Camera movement too static.</li>
            <li>Visuals needed more realism.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Iteration</strong> — refinements included:
          <ul>
            <li>Replaced shaft with a panoramic city view.</li>
            <li>Added dynamic camera pans and slight tilts.</li>
            <li>Improved lighting, textures, and sound design.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Final Testing</strong> — 5 participants with self-reported fear of heights experienced the revised VR (2–3 minutes each) followed by post-session interviews.</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <!-- Findings -->
    <section class="findings">
      <h2>Key Findings</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emotion-first design works:</strong> participants reported dissociation during moments of strongest emotional intensity.</li>
        <li><strong>Immersion depends on realism:</strong> graphics, sound, and camera dynamics combined to sustain presence.</li>
        <li><strong>External control deepened detachment:</strong> when the virtual body moved without input, participants felt less anchored.</li>
        <li><strong>Momentary body forgetting:</strong> multiple participants reported forgetting their real body for brief moments.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Learnings -->
    <section class="learnings">
      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>VR is more than entertainment:</strong> it can act as a laboratory for abstract philosophical ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>Emotions are design levers:</strong> fear, awe, and shock can be intentionally triggered to induce altered states.</li>
        <li><strong>Iteration transforms immersion:</strong> pilot feedback on realism and height was crucial to success.</li>
        <li><strong>Ethical design is critical:</strong> exposure time was limited and participants were fully debriefed to ensure safety.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Impact -->
    <section class="impact">
      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>
        This project demonstrated how <strong>Virtual Reality can bridge philosophy,
        psychology, and design</strong>. By using emotional triggers, VR translated
        Cartesian Dualism from an abstract theory into a lived experience.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Future applications include:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Academic research</strong> — consciousness and altered states.</li>
          <li><strong>Therapeutic use</strong> — exposure therapy and dissociation studies.</li>
          <li><strong>Education</strong> — making complex philosophical theories tangible.</li>
