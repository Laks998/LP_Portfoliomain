    <section class="fade-section" aria-labelledby="background-title">
      <h3 id="background-title">A little background...</h3>

      <p>
        After finishing my architecture degree, I changed my career path to UX/UI design and have been working from home since 2021 due to the Pandemic. Since I had free time outside of work and on weekends, I wanted to volunteer to teach because I enjoyed my experience volunteering for AIESEC to teach kids when I was in college. So, naturally, I began looking for volunteering organisations to teach online in order to sign up for one, and I expected a lot of options and an easy process — but to my surprise, I could not find any until I found one through a friend on Instagram.
      </p>

      <h3>Issues I encountered</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Websites showed “Current cohorts full” — long waiting periods to join.</li>
        <li>Complicated signup processes that discouraged sign-ups.</li>
        <li>No responses after filling out forms.</li>
        <li>Non-functional or broken websites.</li>
        <li>Unattractive interfaces that did not motivate volunteers to sign up.</li>
        <li>Volunteers often did not know job details until after signup.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This indicated there are many graduates, students, homemakers and working professionals who would like to volunteer but are blocked by accessibility, friction, lack of motivation or unclear processes. That also means a child might miss out on a helpful teacher simply because platforms and processes aren't accessible or engaging enough.

        <p class="muted">This is the design process I followed to cover the scope within the timeline.</p>

      <div class="plan-grid">

    <!-- STEP 1: Problem Statement -->
    <section id="step1" class="fade-section" aria-labelledby="step1-title">
      <h2 id="step1-title">Problem Statement</h2>

      <p>
        Stating the problem: a large number of underprivileged children in India lack access to basic education and qualified teachers. While many volunteers want to help, they face barriers finding reliable, simple, and accessible platforms to sign up and teach. NGOs struggle to recruit and retain volunteers due to long processes, poor UX, and lack of motivation for prospective volunteers.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the volunteer point of view the main problems are: long or confusing recruitment, lack of clarity about time commitment, no status updates after applying, and limited discovery of suitable opportunities.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 2: Secondary Research -->
    <section id="step2" class="fade-section" aria-labelledby="step2-title">
      <h2 id="step2-title">Secondary Research</h2>

      <p>
        While India’s economy has grown over the last 25 years, much of that growth is urban-centric. By government estimates, out of roughly 200 million children aged 6–14, about 59 million do not attend school. Of those who start school, many drop out before finishing primary education.
      </p>

      <p>
        A 2002 study highlighted “educational poverty” — very low household investment in education and literacy. Only a small fraction of poor household income goes to education and health, which contributes to unstable learning outcomes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Media and reports have repeatedly pointed to a shortage of qualified and dedicated teachers as a key structural issue. The pandemic introduced widespread virtual volunteering and remote teaching, which opens new opportunities to connect volunteers and students across geographies.
      </p>

      <h3>Virtual volunteering — benefits (summary)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>For volunteers:</strong> more time flexibility, location independence, access for remote or disabled volunteers, and opportunities to fulfil career/education volunteer milestones.</li>
        <li><strong>For NGOs:</strong> access to a wider pool of volunteers, lower operating costs, and improved outreach/branding and data collection.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 3: Primary Research -->
    <section id="step3" class="fade-section" aria-labelledby="step3-title">
      <h2 id="step3-title">Primary Research</h2>

      <p>
        I conducted qualitative interviews with three user groups: NGOs, volunteers (who currently teach), and non-volunteers (people who might potentially volunteer).
      </p>

      <h3>User Interviews</h3>
      <p>I interviewed a manager and leader at U&I (the NGO I volunteer with), several current volunteers, and a few non-volunteers to understand motivations, blockers and pain points.</p>

      <h3>NGO insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Recruiting volunteers is hard — outreach is mostly through college campaigns which are limited and require permissions.</li>
        <li>Volunteers often leave due to time constraints or long recruitment processes.</li>
        <li>Lack of motivating factors or recognition reduces volunteer retention.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Volunteer insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Most volunteers found opportunities through friends or social media stories.</li>
        <li>Many enjoyed remote teaching because it removed travel friction and still felt rewarding.</li>
        <li>Long sign-up processes almost made some volunteers give up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Non-volunteer insights</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Many are not comfortable with technology or don't know where to look for volunteering roles.</li>
        <li>Time commitment is a major concern — short, flexible opportunities are more attractive.</li>
        <li>Some would volunteer only if the commitment was small or better recognized.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 4: Research Analysis & Solutions -->
    <section id="step4" class="fade-section" aria-labelledby="step4-title">
      <h2 id="step4-title">Research Analysis & Solutions</h2>

      <p>
        Synthesising secondary and primary research revealed clear opportunity areas: reduce onboarding friction, provide clear status updates, offer flexible class formats, and create motivating recognition for volunteers.
      </p>

      <h3>Key problems to solve</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Long/complex sign-up causing drop-offs.</li>
        <li>No clear feedback/status after application.</li>
        <li>Restricted discovery of opportunities.</li>
        <li>Low recognition and motivation for volunteers.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Proposed solutions (to test & validate)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an app that aggregates NGO opportunities and lets volunteers filter by subject, timing and preferences.</li>
        <li>Allow volunteers to upload live and pre-recorded classes to support flexible volunteering.</li>
        <li>Introduce a basic eligibility/test step to ensure minimal preparedness and simplify matching.</li>
        <li>Implement community features and gamified micro-tasks or games to keep volunteers engaged.</li>
        <li>Provide rewards and certificates after completing a certain number of sessions to improve retention.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><em>Note:</em> Due to the short timeline, the project focuses on the volunteer-facing flows and interfaces only.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- STEP 5: Wireframes & Final UI -->
    <section id="step5" class="fade-section" aria-labelledby="step5-title">
      <h2 id="step5-title">Wireframes & Final UI</h2>

      <p>
        I produced hand-sketched wireframes and iterated multiple times to determine content hierarchy, card layout types, and a thumb-friendly tab bar. The final interface uses clear card patterns for opportunities, an accessible tab bar (3–5 primary items), and an onboarding flow that reduces friction.
      </p>

      <h3>Design decisions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content priority & placement:</strong> High-priority content is placed for quick scanning.</li>
        <li><strong>Thumb zone:</strong> Main CTAs and navigation are within easy reach on mobile.</li>
        <li><strong>Cards:</strong> Different card types for opportunity lists, matches and classes with clear CTA hierarchy.</li>
        <li><strong>Tab bar:</strong> Limited to 3–5 items to reduce cognitive load.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Interface & Visuals</h3>
      <p>
        Colour palette: vibrant yet subtle to keep the app lively but professional. Typeface: Helvetica for clarity and neutral readability.
      </p>

      <h3>Final screens (examples)</h3>
      <div class="screen-gallery">
        <div class="screen">
          <h4>Login & Sign Up</h4>
          <img src="assets/login_signup.png" alt="Login and Sign Up screen">

        <!-- Add more as needed -->

    <!-- STEP 6: Testing & Refining -->
    <section id="step6" class="fade-section" aria-labelledby="step6-title">
      <h2 id="step6-title">Testing & Refining</h2>

      <p>
        I ran usability tests with three participants who completed key tasks (apply for an opportunity, view status, cancel an upcoming session). Key feedback and changes:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>“After applying, we don't know where the status of the application will be seen” → added a clear “Status / Classes” pathway and a button next to Applied to take the user to the Classes screen.</li>
        <li>“How will I know if I am cancelling the next class or the entire job?” → changed copy to confirm: “Are you sure you want to cancel the upcoming class?”</li>
        <li>“The matches option should be first so that we know if there are any matches first…” → moved Matches to be the default landing content so users see matches first.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        After these refinements the flows were clearer and users felt more confident applying and managing their volunteer commitments.

      <h2 id="extra-title">Notes & Next Steps</h2>

      <p>
        There are many additional product and research directions (NGO-facing workflows, admin dashboards, offline/low-bandwidth support, partnerships with colleges and corporates). This case study focused on an MVP for volunteer onboarding, matching, and flexible class delivery.
      </p>

      <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>
        The proposed V-Ed platform reduces friction, improves discoverability and recognition for volunteers, and adds flexible mechanisms (live + recorded classes) so more people can contribute to education access.
