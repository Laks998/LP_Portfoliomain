          The goal of this app is to create an education platform that connects volunteers to teach, with NGOs

        <h2>A Little Background</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing my architecture degree, I changed my career path to UX/UI design and have been working 
          from home since 2021 due to the Pandemic. Since I had free time outside of work and on weekends, I wanted 
          to volunteer to teach because I enjoyed my experience volunteering for AIESEC to teach kids when I was in 
          college. So, naturally, I began looking for volunteering organisations to teach online in order to sign up 
          for one, and I expected a lot of options and an easy process — but to my surprise, I could not find any 
          until I found one through a friend on Instagram.

          This means that there must be more graduates, students, homemakers and working professionals like me who

          that maybe a kid could have got a good teacher but couldn't because of the lack of accessibility and motivation.

        <h2>Looking Around to Find the Need for a Solution</h2>
        <p>
          While the economy of India has appeared to have boomed over the last 25 years, most growth has been in 
          urban areas where large multinational corporations base their software development headquarters. In spite 
          of all this, by the government estimate, out of 200 million children in the age group of 6 to 14 in India, 
          around 59 million do not attend school. Of the rest, who are currently in school, four out of every 10 
          children beginning to attend school will drop out before completing their primary school education.
        </p>
        <p>
          A study in 2002 found that these conditions in India are partially due to educational poverty, defined as 
          the deprivation of basic education and literacy. Only 6% of the income from poor households is invested in 
          education and health, while the majority is spent on other necessities such as food and fuel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In an article by India Today, there is some light on why education is still a distant dream, for many 
          underprivileged children in the country. According to the report, one of the primary reasons is an 
          "extreme shortage of qualified and dedicated teachers."

        <h2>Testing & Refining</h2>
        <p>
          I ran usability tests with three participants who completed key tasks (apply for an opportunity, view status, 
          cancel an upcoming session). Key feedback and changes:
        </p>
        
        <div class="feedback-list">
          <div class="feedback-item">
            <div class="feedback-quote">"After applying, we don't know where the status of the application will be seen"</div>
            <div class="feedback-action">→ Added a clear "Status / Classes" pathway and a button next to Applied to take the user to the Classes screen</div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="feedback-item">
            <div class="feedback-quote">"How will I know if I am cancelling the next class or the entire job?"</div>
            <div class="feedback-action">→ Changed copy to confirm: "Are you sure you want to cancel the upcoming class?"</div>
          </div>
          
          <div class="feedback-item">
            <div class="feedback-quote">"The matches option should be first so that we know if there are any matches first..."</div>
            <div class="feedback-action">→ Moved Matches to be the default landing content so users see matches first</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        
        <p>
          After these refinements the flows were clearer and users felt more confident applying and managing their 
          volunteer commitments.

        <h2>Notes & Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          There are many additional product and research directions (NGO-facing workflows, admin dashboards, 
          offline/low-bandwidth support, partnerships with colleges and corporates). This case study focused on an 
          MVP for volunteer onboarding, matching, and flexible class delivery.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          The proposed V-Ed platform reduces friction, improves discoverability and recognition for volunteers, and 
          adds flexible mechanisms (live + recorded classes) so more people can contribute to education access.
