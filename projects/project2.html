      <h2>My Role</h2>
      <p>I started my journey with Clearisk as a UX/UI designer in November 2021. At that time, their applications (CX Portal and Client Portal) were in the early stages and had not yet been launched to users, with only high-priority features available. While a basic design system was already established, the remaining features were still in development. I worked on modifying and enhancing a few existing features and began designing new ones. 
</p>
      <p>For this B2B product, the dashboard had not been created yet. We started by having a few of our team members, as well as some potential users from the partner company, try out different features. We quickly realized the need and importance of a dashboard.
</p>
      <p>As the solo designer, I was responsible for everything from identifying needs, gathering and evaluating user requirements, and interviewing users to creating flows and designs.
</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>How Did I Start?</h2>
      <p>I needed to first get to know the product features much better to know what was expected of the feature. I used the following ways to get to know the product better</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Internal resources:</strong>  Asked around the internal team about the working of different user groups, their connectivity/flow and intersection points</li>
        <li><strong>External resources:</strong>  Used resources from the internet to find more information on the domain and the competitors (As it was a B2B product, not a lot of competitor products were accessible to outsiders due to privacy issues)</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Business Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>The dashboard is an important feature for Clearisk and its stakeholders for different reasons like</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To increase application engagement by reducing reliance on E-mail, Slack, and other platforms</li>
        <li>Overview at the beginning of the day for employees to plan the day and prioritise tasks.</li>
        <li>Ability to have customized data for the different roles without overwhelming them with unnecessary information.</li>
        <li>A summary of their weekly work completed and pending to get an idea of the total amount of work completed and if there is any pending work that needs to be addressed.</li>
        <li>Quick access to the areas that require attention without having to go to individual menu options to check for them.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Solution with Hypothesis</h2>
      <p>Understanding the following factors to know how the Dashboard should be displayed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Users and Stakeholders:</strong> The different users accessing Clearisk and their expectations from the application and the stakeholder requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Roles and Permissions:</strong> The different roles and their working in the application and the Modules/functions contained in it.</li>
        <li><strong>Current workflow:</strong> Understanding the current workflow(on their own and with other employees in different roles) and identifying what parts of the process are currently dependent on other products like Emails and Slack for each user type.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Data that requires attention should have quick access from the dashboard without having to go to individual menu options to check for it.</li>
        <li><strong>Present Painpoints:</strong>  The parts with issues and shortcomings that disrupt the smooth working of the task flow presently to find how to resolve it with the dashboard.</li>
        <li><strong>Needs, wants and desires:</strong> What information cannot be ignored, what elements would make the application a good one, and what luxury features would elevate the application to the next level for each role?</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

  <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p>
      Our design process started with user research, where we identified major stakeholder roles and mapped their responsibilities.

        <h3>User Research ‚Äì Roles and Functions</h3>
        <p>
          The major stakeholders of the product fall under six categories, each serving distinct roles and having permissions to different parts of the app:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Manager</strong></li>
          <li><strong>System Admin</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Treasury</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Compliance</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Partner Admin</strong></li>
          <li><strong>TPRS Admin</strong></li>
        </ol>

      <h3>Qualitative Analysis</h3>
      <p>I conducted an interview with one user from each major role and asked them a semi-structured set of questions to know the basic requirements of each of the roles and then I could spread out into the common parts and specific parts of the design</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Interview duration:</strong> 20 mins each</li>
        <li><strong>Participants:</strong> 5</li>
        <li><strong>Number of questions:</strong> 10</li>

      <h3>Persona</h3>
      <p>I created personas based on the interview of the different roles with their key characteristics, goals, frustrations and motivations to understand the users and their feelings towards the feature.</p>

      <h3>Information Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        I created a combined IA for all the roles to understand the different sections required 
        and what sections are common and what needs to be customised. Also, to know what the 
        customisations should be.

      <h3>Zoning/Placement of Sections ‚Äì Z-Pattern</h3>
      <p>The Z- the pattern is the visual route of a human eye when viewing content on a page. people scan from the top left to the top right, forming an imaginary horizontal line. Next, down and to the left side of the visible page, in an imaginary diagonal line and then to the right.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Top Left:</strong> Overview</li>
        <li><strong>Top Right:</strong> Applications requiring action</li>
        <li><strong>Bottom Left:</strong> Activity timeline</li>
