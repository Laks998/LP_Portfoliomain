        <p>
          Sportscove connects sports learners with expert coaches across the US, Canada, and India. I joined when the product existed only as confusing wireframes with fundamental UX issues. My challenge was to redesign the entire experience—focusing on user flows, information architecture, and systematic design thinking.

              <p class="decision-subtitle">Restructuring the entire booking experience for multi-sport coaches</p>

              <h4>The Problem</h4>
              <p>
                The original design had a fundamental flaw: it placed a single "Book" button at the bottom of the profile. For multi-sport coaches, this forced users through an extra step—after clicking Book, they had to select which sport they wanted before proceeding.
              </p>
              <p>
                The original wireframes assumed all coaches taught only one sport. However, SportsCove doesn't exclusively work with international-level coaches—the platform also includes retired athletes and lower-level coaches who often have expertise in multiple sports. For example, a boxing coach might also teach Muay Thai, or a yoga instructor might offer pilates.
              </p>
              <p class="emphasis-text">
                The existing design hadn't accounted for multi-sport coaches at all, despite this being a reality from day one.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="decision-section">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>
                I completely restructured the profile and booking flow:

                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Course card separation:</strong> Each sport needed its own visual identity. This made it immediately clear that the coach offers multiple distinct services, not just variations of one sport.

                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Individual book CTAs:</strong> Moving the Book button from the profile bottom to each course card eliminated an entire step in the flow. Users' intent became explicit—when they click Book on "Boxing", we know exactly what they want.

                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Contextual information updates:</strong> When users switch between sport tabs, showing sport-specific experience and certifications reinforces expertise and builds trust.

                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Class transparency:</strong> The old design hid what classes entailed. By showing detailed class descriptions with learning outcomes, users could make informed decisions before booking.

                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Self-assessment integration:</strong> Instead of making users guess which class level to book, the self-assessment test automatically places them, reducing anxiety and wrong bookings.

                <li>
                  <strong>Class structure clarity:</strong> Individual classes and Group classes are clearly differentiated, with their respective structures presented without forcing users to backtrack.

                <li>
                  <strong>Pricing transparency:</strong> Class-specific pricing is displayed clearly before booking, allowing different costs for different classes.

                <li>
                  <strong>Premium upsell:</strong> "Become a Premium learner now!" is positioned strategically after users are already engaged with the content.

                How to represent multi-sport coaches clearly on search and discovery cards without cluttering the interface? This became critical once we redesigned the booking flow to support multiple sports per coach.

                  <h5>Option 1: Show all sports on card</h5>

                <div class="option-item rejected">
                  <h5>Option 2: Show one sport with (+3) indicator</h5>
                  <p>Showing "Boxing (+3)" was ambiguous—users didn't know what the "+3" meant. More critically, if a user searched for "Muay Thai" and saw a coach card showing "Boxing (+3)", they'd likely skip it, missing a relevant result.</p>

            <div class="decision-section">
              <h4>Decision Framework</h4>
              <p>I evaluated each notification using five criteria:</p>
              <div class="criteria-list">
                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>User impact:</strong> Would missing this cause loss, confusion, or missed income?
                </div>
                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Time sensitivity:</strong> Does this require immediate or scheduled action?
                </div>
                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Role relevance:</strong> Is this for the user as a learner or coach?
                </div>
                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Frequency & fatigue:</strong> Would this become annoying over time?
                </div>
                <div class="criteria-item">
                  <strong>Development cost:</strong> Does the value justify the engineering effort?
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="decision-section highlight-section">
              <h4>The Solution</h4>
              <p>Only essential, high-impact notifications were retained:</p>

              <h4>Role-Based Clarity</h4>
              <p>To prevent confusion for dual-role users, I designed role-specific notification formats:</p>

                <li>Clear wording ensured immediate context recognition</li>

                <strong>Strategic thinking over execution:</strong> The most impactful work happened in decision-making frameworks, not pixel-pushing. Understanding constraints and trade-offs shaped better outcomes.
