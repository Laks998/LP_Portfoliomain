    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section class="story-intro">
      <p>
        I didn't wake up one day wanting to be a UX designer. I studied architecture for five years, 
        only to realize I didn't actually like designing buildings. What I loved was organizing complex 
        information, simplifying problems, and creating experiences that just <span class="highlight">made sense</span>. 
        I just didn't know there was a career for that yet.

          <h2>The wrong path (that taught me the right skills)</h2>
          <p class="timeline-meta">Bachelor of Architecture</p>
          <p>
            Five years studying architecture. Learning about spatial planning, user flows through buildings, 
            visual hierarchy, and how design impacts human behavior. But here's the truth: I didn't enjoy 
            designing buildings. The construction, the materials, the site visits—it wasn't for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I did love? Breaking down complex problems. Organizing information so it was intuitive. 
            Creating systems that helped people understand things better. I was good at making complicated 
            things simple. I just didn't know that was a job.
          </p>
          <div class="insight">

          <h2>Discovering UX/UI by accident</h2>
          <p class="timeline-meta">Transition period</p>
          <p>
            After graduating, I knew I didn't want to be an architect. I decided to pivot to illustration, 
            something I genuinely enjoyed. I applied for illustration jobs, took on freelance work, built a 
            portfolio. Then I got a job offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it wasn't for an illustrator. It was for a UX/UI designer role. I had no idea what UX/UI even 
            meant, but I googled it and everything clicked. Designing how people interact with products. 
            Simplifying complex flows. Making interfaces intuitive. This was exactly what I loved doing, I 
            just never knew it had a name.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enrolled in a UX/UI bootcamp immediately. Learned the fundamentals—wireframing, prototyping, 
            user research, design thinking. And suddenly, all those skills from architecture made sense in a 
            new context.
          </p>

            <strong>The moment everything changed:</strong> UX design was the career I'd been looking for without knowing it existed—designing experiences, not buildings

          <p class="timeline-meta">Clearisk, UX/UI Designer</p>
          <p>
            My first UX role was at Clearisk, for a fintech SaaS platform. I knew nothing about finance. Nothing 
            about trading or treasury management. But I had three months as an associate designer to learn, 
            then I was leading the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designed trader onboarding flows. Built a CX portal for multiple user roles. Created document 
            management systems. Reduced drop-off rates by 35%, rage clicks by 50%. Improved efficiency by 40%. 
            The metrics were great, but what mattered more was this: I genuinely enjoyed the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first time, I was solving real problems for real users. Simplifying complex finance 
            workflows. Making intimidating interfaces approachable. This was what I wanted to do.

          <p class="timeline-meta">Freelance UX/UI Designer</p>
          <p>
            Before starting my masters, I freelanced. Worked with an HR-focused app. 
            Designed a platform connecting users with premium stores in Dubai. Helped an 
            edtech startup improve their personal growth website.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each project was different. Different users. Different problems. Different constraints. But the 
            process was the same: understand the users, simplify the complexity, design intuitive flows.

          <p class="timeline-meta">MSc Human-Computer Interaction</p>
          <p>
            My first role made me fall in love with UX design. But I wanted to understand it properly, not just 
            how to design interfaces, but why users behave the way they do. So I pursued an MSc in Human Computer 
            Interaction at the University of Nottingham.
          </p>
          <p>
            Studied cognitive psychology. Learned research methodologies. Explored accessibility and inclusive 
            design. Conducted VR research on Cartesian dualism. Gained the academic foundation to back up my 
            design intuitions with evidence.

          <p>
            Got married. Moved back to India. Took time to reflect on what I actually wanted. All my roles had 
            been "UX/UI designer," but when I looked back honestly, most of my work was UX-focused. Research. 
            User flows. Information architecture. Problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, I designed interfaces. But what I really enjoyed, what I was actually good at, was figuring out 
            how to make complex things simple and intuitive for users.

          <p>
            Worked at Consultcraft designing a sports coaching platform. Redesigned user flows, built design 
            systems from scratch, created custom illustrations and animations. Collaborated with developers, 
            CEO, and advisors to launch across the US, Canada, and India.
          </p>
          <p>
            This role confirmed what I'd been realizing: while my title said "UX/UI designer," my strength 
            was in UX. I understand visual design, but my real value was in understanding users, simplifying 
            complexity, and designing experiences that just worked.

          <h2>Taking the leap: building my own product</h2>
          <p class="timeline-meta">Building Quippy</p>
          <p>
            After leaving Consultcraft in early October, I decided to work full-time on <strong>Quippy</strong>—a 
            browser extension I'd been building on the side. Launched it a month and a half ago for initial testing, 
            and it's now live for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is different from client work. I'm designing for users I need to find, iterating based on real 
            feedback, and learning what it takes to ship and maintain a product independently. It's scary and 
            exciting at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also preparing to move to Canada in May 2025. New country, new chapter, new opportunities ahead.

          <div class="why-box">
            <h3>So why did I become a UX designer?</h3>
            <p>
              Because I stumbled into it by accident and discovered it was exactly what I'd been looking for. 
              A career where I could take complex problems and make them simple. Where I could organize chaos 
              into clarity. Where I could design experiences that help people accomplish their goals without 
              friction.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't choose UX design because I loved buildings or technology. I chose it because I love 
              <em>solving problems for people</em>, and UX design is the best tool I've found to do that.
