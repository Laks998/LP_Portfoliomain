          I didn't wake up one day wanting to be a ux designer. I studied architecture for five years, 
          only to realize I didn't actually like designing buildings. What I loved was organizing complex 
          information, simplifying problems, and creating experiences that just <em>made sense</em>. I 
          just didn't know there was a career for that yet.

          <h2>The wrong path (that taught me the right skills)</h2>
          <p>
            Five years studying architecture. Learning about spatial planning, user flows through buildings, 
            visual hierarchy, and how design impacts human behavior. But here's the truth: I didn't enjoy 
            designing buildings. the construction, the materials, the site visits—it wasn't for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I did love? Breaking down complex problems. Organizing information so it was intuitive. 
            Creating systems that helped people understand things better. I was good at making complicated 
            things simple. I just didn't know that was a job.

          <h2>Discovering UX/UI by accident</h2>
          <p>
            After graduating, I knew I didn't want to be an architect. I decided to pivot to illustration, something I genuinely enjoyed. I applied for illustration jobs, took on freelance work, built a portfolio. Then I got a job offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            but it wasn't for an illustrator. it was for a ux/ui designer role. i had no idea what ux/ui even 
            meant, but i googled it and everything clicked. designing how people interact with products. 
            simplifying complex flows. making interfaces intuitive. this was exactly what i loved doing, i 
            just never knew it had a name.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enrolled in a UX/UI bootcamp immediately. Learned the fundamentals—wireframing, prototyping, 
            user research, design thinking. and suddenly, all those skills from architecture made sense in a 
            new context.
          </p>

            <div class="insight-label">the moment everything changed</div>
            <p>ux design was the career i'd been looking for without knowing it existed—designing experiences, not buildings</p>

          <p>
            My first ux role was at clearisk, for a fintech saas platform. I knew nothing about finance. Nothing 
            about trading or treasury management. But I had three months as an associate designer to learn, 
            then I was leading the design.
          </p>
          <p>
            Designed trader onboarding flows. Built a CX portal for multiple user roles. Created document 
            management systems. Reduced drop-off rates by 35%, rage clicks by 50%. Improved efficiency by 40%. 
            The metrics were great, but what mattered more was this: I genuinely enjoyed the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first time, I was solving real problems for real users. Simplifying complex finance 
            workflows. Making intimidating interfaces approachable. This was what I wanted to do.

          <p>
            Each project was different. Different users. Different problems. Different constraints. Dut the

          <h2>Going deeper into the why</h2>
          <p>
            My first role made me fall in love with ux design. But I wanted to understand it properly, not just 
            how to design interfaces, but why users behave the way they do. So I pursued an MSc in Human Computer 
            Interaction at the University of Nottingham.

          <p>
            Studied cognitive psychology. Learned research methodologies. Explored accessibility and inclusive 
            design. Conducted vr research on cartesian dualism. Gained the academic foundation to back up my 
            design intuitions with evidence.

          <h2>Life happens alongside careers</h2>
          <p>
            Got married. Moved back to india. Took time to reflect on what I actually wanted. All my roles had 
            been "ux/ui designer," but when I looked back honestly, most of my work was ux-focused. Research. 
            User flows. Information architecture. Problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, I designed interfaces. But what I really enjoyed, what I was actually good at, was figuring out 
            how to make complex things simple and intuitive for users.

          <h2>Clarity on what I do best</h2>
          <p>
          Currently working at Consultcraft. Redesigning user flows. Building design systems from 
            scratch. Creating custom illustrations and animations. Collaborating with developers, CEO, and advisors.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's what I've realized: while my title says "ux/ui designer," my strength is in ux. I'm not 
            blind to colours, I understand visual design. But my real value is in understanding users, simplifying 
            complexity, and designing experiences that just work.
          </p>
          <div class="why-box">
            <h3>So why did I become a ux designer?</h3>
            <p>
              Because I stumbled into it by accident and discovered it was exactly what I'd been looking for. 
              A career where I could take complex problems and make them simple. Where I could organize chaos 
              into clarity. Where I could design experiences that help people accomplish their goals without 
              friction.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn't choose ux design because I loved buildings or technology. I chose it because I love 
              <em>solving problems for people</em> and ux design is the best tool I've found to do that.
